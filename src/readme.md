# Project Positive Message :D

Hello there! Thank for checking this out!

## What is the point of this project?
The point of this project is to make someone's day! Before making this, I 
noticed that a lot of my friends were struggling with their mental health 
and many of them couldn't reach out for help/didn't see the reason to keep 
going. By making this, I wanted to put in a bunch of messages to boost
their self esteem and help them in their worse times.

### Updates
I will be trying to update this with more features and fixes in the code. The
version indicates where I am up to/how many features there are. The first
digit is how many features there are (but you have to add one.) The reason why 
it's one less than how many features there areis because I started off with two 
features, aka version 1. I will try my best to add more new ideas, but it 
might take a while.
