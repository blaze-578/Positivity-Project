# Project Positive Message :D

Hello there! Thank for checking this out!

## What is the point of this project?
The point of this project is to make someone's day! Before making this, I 
noticed that a lot of my friends were struggling with their mental health 
and many of them couldn't reach out for help/didn't see the reason to keep 
going. By making this, I wanted to put in a bunch of messages to boost
their self esteem and help them in their worse times.
