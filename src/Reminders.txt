Eat something, sometimes even a snack makes a difference!
Don't forget to use the bathroom!
Don't forget to get out of bed!
Just as a reminder, you're your own person, you're strong and independent.
Don't forget to drink lots of water, hydration is great!
Here, have a kit kat. It's okay to take a break sometimes
Just because someone has it worse than you does not mean your feelings are invalid.
No matter what is going on, I believe in you. After all darkness there is light <3
You are loved :)
One day you will look back at your struggles in the past and you'll be proud you never gave up. So keep going, you got this!
Celebrate the little things in life!
Small steps are still steps! I\'m proud of you for taking some!
You owe yourself the love you give others so easily
You aren't required to impress anyone with your life choices
Don't forget to do your homework! (and if you don't have any, well then don't forget to do your adult stuff)
Don't measure your own progress using someone else's ruler
You can still love yourself and be a work in progress
You deserve love and some time for yourself.
Remember to smile!
